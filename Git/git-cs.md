# GIT CHEAT SHEET

## Git installation

**Linux:**

For GNU/Linux distributions, Git should be available in the standard
system repository. For example, in Debian/Ubuntu please type in
the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

**Windows:**

htps://windows.github.com

**Mac:**

htps://mac.github.com

**Git for All Platforms:**

htps://git-scm.com

## Git configuration

Set the name that will be attached to your commits and tags.

```bash
git config --global user.name “[Your Name[”
```

Set the e-mail address that will be attached to your commits and tags.

```bash
git config --global user.email “[you@example.com[”
```

Set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing.

```bash
git config --global color.ui auto
```

## Starting a Project

Create a new local repository. If **[project name]** is provided, Git will create a new directory name **[project name]** and will initialize a repository inside it. If **[project name]** is not provided, then a new repository is initialized in the current directory.

```bash
git init [project name]
```

Downloads a project with the entire history from the remote repository.

```bash
git clone [project url]
```

## Day-To-Day Work

Displays the status of your **working directory**. Options include new, staged, and modified files. It will retrieve branch name, current commit identifier, and changes pending commit.

```bash
git status
```

Add a file to the **staging area**. Use in place of the full file path to add all changed files from the **current directory** down into the **directory tree**.

```bash
git add [file]
```

Show changes between **working directory** and **staging area**.

```bash
git diff [file]
```

Shows any changes between the **staging area** and the **repository**.

```bash
git diff --staged [file]
```

Discard changes in **working directory**. This operation is **unrecoverable**.

```bash
git checkout -- [file]
```

Revert your **repository** to a previous known working state.

```bash
git reset [file]
```

Create a new commit from changes added to the **staging area**. The **commit** must have a message!

```bash
git commit -m “[descriptive message]”
```

Remove file from **working directory** and **staging area**.

```bash
git rm [file]
```

Put current changes in your **working directory** into **stash** for later use.

```bash
git stash
```

Apply stored **stash** content into **working directory**, and clear **stash**.

```bash
git stash pop
```

Delete a specific **stash** from all your previous **stashes**.

```bash
git stash drop
```

## Git branching model

List all local branches in repository. With **-a**: show all branches (with remote).

```bash
git branch [-a]
```

Create new branch, referencing the current **HEAD**.

```bash
git branch [branch_name]
```

Switch **working directory** to the specified branch. With **-b**: Git will create the specified branch if it does not exist.

```bash
git checkout [-b][branch_name]
```

Join specified **[from name]** branch into your current branch (the one you are on currently).

```bash
git merge [from name]
```

Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other.
**-D** instead of **-d** forces deletion.

```bash
git branch -d [name]
```

## Review your work

List commit history of current branch. **-n count** limits list to last **n** commits.

```bash
git log [-n count]
```

An overview with reference labels and history graph. One commit per line.

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

List commits that are present on the current branch and not merged into **ref**. A **ref** can be a branch name or a tag name.

```bash
git log ref..
```

List commit that are present on **ref** and not merged into current branch.

```bash
git log ..ref
```

List operations (e.g. checkouts or commits) made on local repository.

```bash
git reflog
```

## Tagging known commits

List all tags.

```bash
git tag
```

Create a tag reference named **name** for current commit. Add **commit sha** to tag a specific commit instead of current one.

```bash
git tag [name] [commit sha]
```

Create a tag object named **name** for current commit.

```bash
git tag -a [name] [commit sha]
```

Remove a tag from local repository.

```bash
git tag -d [name]
```

## Reverting changes

Switches the current branch to the **target reference**, leaving a difference as an uncommitted change. When **--hard** is used, all changes are discarded.

```bash
git reset [--hard] [target reference]
```

Create a new commit, reverting changes from the specified commit. It generates an **inversion** of changes.

```bash
git revert [commit sha]
```

## Synchronizing repositories

Fetch changes from the **remote**, but not update tracking branches.

```bash
git fetch [remote]
```

Delete remote Refs that were removed from the **remote** repository.

```bash
git fetch --prune [remote]
```

Fetch changes from the **remote** and merge current branch with its upstream.

```bash
git pull [remote]
```

Push local changes to the **remote**. Use **--tags** to push tags.

```bash
git push [--tags] [remote]
```

Push local branch to **remote** repository. Set its copy as an upstream.

```bash
git push -u [remote] [branch]
```

!!! Commit
an object
!!! Branch
a reference to a commit; can have a **tracked upstream**
!!! Tag
a reference (standard) or an object (annotated)
!!! Head
a place where your **working directory** is now

## Ignoring Files

Verify the .gitignore file exists in your project and ignore certain type of files, such as all files in **logs** directory (excluding the **.gitkeep** file), whole **tmp** directory and all files **\*.swp**. File ignoring will work for the directory (and children directories) where **.gitignore** file is placed.

```bash
$ cat .gitignore
/logs/*
!logs/.gitkeep
/tmp
*.swp
```

System wide ignore pattern for all local repositories.

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
```
