# Git

## Overview

### What is Git?

#### Version 1

Git is a 'distributed version control system'.

Which basically means:

- It's a system that records changes to our files over time.
- We can recall specific versions of those files at any given time.
- Many people can easily collaborate on a project and have their own version of project files on their computer.

#### Version 2

A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) for tracking changes in computer files

- Distributed version control
- Coordinates work between multiple developers
- Who made what change and when
- Revert at any time
- Local & remote repos

### Concepts of Git

- Keeps track of code history
- Takes "snapshots" of your files
- You decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit"
- You can visit any snapshot at any time
- You can stage files before committing

### Why use GIT?

- Store revisions in a project history in just one directory.
- Rewind to any revision in the project you want to.
- Work on new features without messing up the main codebase.
- Easily collaborate with other people.

### GitHub

- Online service that hosts our projects.
- Share our code with other developers.
- Developers can download the projects and work on them.
- They can re-upload their edits and merge them with the main codebase.

## How Git works?

### Repositories

- A repo is a container for a project you want to track with Git (e.g. a website, software project).
- Can have many repos for many projects on your computer.
- Like a project folder which Git tracks the contents for us.

### Commits

You can think of commits as safe points for your work.

Before being committed a file can pass through different states:

- Untracked
- Unmodified
- Modified
- Staged
